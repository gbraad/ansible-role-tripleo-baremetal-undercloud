ansible-role-tripleo-baremetal-undercloud
=========

This role aims to build a baremetal undercloud machine from scratch. Using tripleo-quickstart, this means that you will be able to provide, prepare and install the undercloud on a physical machine.

From the tripleo-quickstart perspective virthost and undercloud will be the same host.

Requirements
------------

For make all the things working you need to have an environment with all the things in place:

Hardware requirements

* A physical machine for the undercloud that can be accessed as root from the jump host
* At least two other physical machines that will become controller and compute, for HA three controllers and one compute are needed
* A working network link between _overcloud_ and _undercloud_, typically the second net device of the undercloud will talk to the first net device of all the overcloud machines

Software requirements

* The tripleo-quickstart `quickstart.sh` script:
    * A config file (i.e. `ha.yml`) containing all the customizations for the baremetal environment
* This set of files, dependent from the hardware:
    * File `undercloud-provisioning.sh` - optional, name is not important
    * File `network-environment.yaml` - mandatory
    * Directory `nic-configs` - mandatory if declared inside the **resource_registry** section in `network-environment.yaml` and must contain all the needed files
    * File `instackenv.json` - mandatory, must contain the IPMI credentials for the nodes

Role Variables
--------------

A typical config file will contain something like this:

    undercloud_type: baremetal

    flavor_map:
      control: baremetal
      compute: baremetal
      storage: baremetal
      ceph: baremetal

    overcloud_nodes:
      - name: control_0
        flavor: baremetal
      - name: control_1
        flavor: baremetal
      - name: control_2
        flavor: baremetal

      - name: compute_0
        flavor: baremetal
      - name: compute_1
        flavor: baremetal

    # Steps
    step_introspect: true
    step_introspect_with_retry: true
    step_provide_undercloud: true
    step_overcloud_images: true
    step_install_undercloud: true
    step_prepare_undercloud: true

    libvirt_type: kvm
    libvirt_args: "--libvirt-type kvm"

    undercloud_local_interface: eth1

    baremetal_provisioning_script: "/path/to/undercloud-provisioning.sh"
    baremetal_network_environment: "/path/to/network-environment.yaml"
    baremetal_instackenv: "/path/to/instackenv.json"
    baremetal_nic_configs: "/path/to/nic_configs"

    floating_ip_cidr: "<FLOATING NETWORK CIDR>"
    public_net_pool_start: "<FLOATING NETWORK POOL START>"
    public_net_pool_end: "<FLOATING NETWORK POOL END>"
    public_net_gateway: "<FLOATING NETWORK GATEWAY>"

    extra_args: "--ntp-server <NTP SERVER IP> --control-scale 3 --compute-scale 2 --ceph-storage-scale 0 --block-storage-scale 0 --swift-storage-scale 0 --templates -e /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environments/puppet-pacemaker.yaml -e /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environments/network-isolation.yaml -e /home/stack/network-environment.yaml --neutron-bridge-mappings datacentre:br-floating"
    tempest: false

A brief explanation of the variables:

* The variable **undercloud_type** is checked in all the dependent roles (see @Dependencies)
* A specific **flavor_map** (in this case baremetal) needs to be applied to each node kind
* The list of all the **overcloud_nodes** must be explicited
* With **step_introspect** and **step_introspect_with_retry** you can choose if you want to introspect and even retry again for host that failed introspection
* The **libvirt_type** and **libvirt_args** must be set to kvm, since we will work on baremetal with native virtual capabilities
* The **undercloud_local_interface** needs to be changed accordingly to the baremetal hardware
* If the user does not need to provide the machine, then **baremetal_provisioning_script**  can be omitted while setting also **step_provide_undercloud: false**
* **baremetal_network_environment**, **baremetal_instackenv** and *optionally* **baremetal_nic_configs** will contain all the environment files.
* **extra_args** will contain all deploy specific (like HA settings)
* **tempest** will enable tempest tests
* If instances needs to be accessible from the outside network then all the parameters (so **floating_ip_cidr** and **public_net_***) of this floating network must be explicited.

The main task of the role is this one:

    ---
    # tasks file for ansible-role-tripleo-baremetal-undercloud

    - include: machine-provisioning.yml
      tags:
        - machine-provision

    - include: machine-setup.yml
      tags:
        - machine-setup

    - include: undercloud-scripts.yml
      delegate_to: "{{ virthost }}"
      tags:
        - undercloud-scripts

    - include: undercloud-pre-install.yml
      delegate_to: "{{ virthost }}"
      tags:
        - undercloud-pre-install

    - include: undercloud-install.yml
      delegate_to: "{{ virthost }}"
      tags:
        - undercloud-install

    - include: overcloud-images.yml
      delegate_to: "{{ virthost }}"
      tags:
        - overcloud-images

Some notes about the main task file:

* Even if virthost and undercloud are the same machine, the name “undercloud” will be inventoried after (see the baremetal playbook slide)
* Each action is tagged so it is possible to exclude a specific section, but...
* In any case some variables can be controlled via config settings:
    * step_provide_undercloud: choose if you want to do machine provisioning
    * step_install_repos_undercloud: choose if you want to prepare the undercloud machine wirh repositories and all the packages needed
    * step_install_undercloud: choose if you want to install the undercloud
    * step_overcloud_images: choose if you want to download overcloud images

This is basically what the specific tasks does:

* `machine-provisioning.yml` provides the machine and make it become both virthost/undercloud 
* `machine-setup.yml` prepares the undercloud with ssh connections, users, sudoers and inventory addition
* `undercloud-scripts.yml` copies all the needed scripts into virthost/undercloud
* `undercloud-pre-install.yml` selinux, firewall, repositories and packages 
* `undercloud-install.yml` installs the undercloud
* `overcloud-images.yml` retrieves the overcloud images

Dependencies
------------

If you don't need to change anything in how the environments gets deployed, then all the dependencies should be satisfied by the default `requirements.txt` file.

In any case the roles you will need to deploy an entire environment from scratch (see @Example Playbook) are:

* **ansible-role-tripleo-inventory**
* **ansible-role-tripleo-undercloud-post**
* **ansible-role-tripleo-overcloud**
* **ansible-role-tripleo-overcloud-validate**
* **ansible-role-tripleo-overcloud-validate-ha** (this is optional if you want to test HA capabilities)

Example Playbook
----------------

Here's is an example on host to use this role in combination to all the others coming from various related to tripleo-quickstart:

    ---
    - name:  Baremetal undercloud install
      hosts: localhost
      roles:
        - tripleo-baremetal-undercloud
      tags:
        - undercloud-bm-install

    - name:  Inventory the undercloud
      hosts: localhost
      vars:
          inventory: undercloud
      roles:
        - tripleo-inventory
      tags:
        - undercloud-inventory

    - name:  Post undercloud install steps
      hosts: undercloud
      roles:
        - tripleo-undercloud-post
      tags:
        - undercloud-post-install

    - name:  Deploy the overcloud
      hosts: undercloud
      gather_facts: no
      roles:
        - tripleo-overcloud
      tags:
        - overcloud-deploy

    - name:  Inventory the overcloud
      hosts: undercloud
      vars:
          inventory: all
      roles:
        - tripleo-inventory
      tags:
        - overcloud-inventory

    - name:  validate the overcloud
      hosts: undercloud
      gather_facts: no
      roles:
        - tripleo-overcloud-validate
      tags:
        - overcloud-validate

The steps of the sample playbook are these:

* First invoked role is tripleo-baremeal-undercloud undercloud
* Then undercloud is inventoried
* In the post task all the env files are pushed into undercloud, introspection is performed and a default route external interface is created for the overcloud network access
* Overcloud is then deployed, inventoried and validated

Then you can invoke *quickstart.sh* like this:

    ./quickstart.sh -v --clean --playbook baremetal-undercloud.yml --working-dir /path/to/workdir --requirements /path/to/requirements.txt --config /path/to/config.yml --release mitaka --tags all <HOSTNAME or IP>

Basically this command:

* Uses the playbook `baremetal-undercloud.yml`
* Uses a custom workdir that is rebuilt from scratch (so if it already exists, it is dropped)
* Performs all the tasks in the playbook
* Chooses release (liberty, mitaka or “master” for newton)
* Starts the installation on virthost
